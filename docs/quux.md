# QUUX

QUUX is the CADR evolved: the same processor, buses and boards, changed where
a change pays for itself. It is chosen with `--machine quux` in muir, and by
the same flag in muir-fpga and muir-sys; `--machine cadr`, the default, is
the CADR as MIT built it. Back to [the manual](manual.md).

This page says where QUUX differs from the CADR. Everything it does not
mention is the CADR's.

## What each difference reaches

A change to the hardware reaches further than the board: the boot PROM,
the microcode, the Lisp system in the band, and the tools that read a
machine's state can all depend on what changed. For each of QUUX's
differences, what it needed:

| Difference | Boot PROM | Microcode | Lisp system | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Six-bit level-1 map entry | nothing: MIT's PROM boots it; version 1000 also clears QUUX's 64 blocks | 1000: the six-bit read, the two-deposit write, invalid block 77, the reverse first-level map moved to system communication area 640-737 and the swap-out CCWs to 440-457 | nothing: System 1001 runs unchanged | CC's remote debugger (`CADR-DEBUGGER`) still assumes the CADR's map |
| MACHINE-ID in functional source 16 | nothing | 1000 reads it at boot and runs as either machine | `PROCESSOR-TYPE-CODE` is 4 | nothing |
| The feature page | nothing | nothing: field widths are fixed when the microcode is assembled | does not read it yet | do not read it yet |
| `MUL` and `DIV` in one instruction | nothing | none uses them yet; the microassembler needs names for ALU functions 42 and 43 | nothing | nothing |

## The map

**A level-1 entry is six bits, not five.** The level-1 map names, for each
8K-word region of virtual memory, a block of 32 level-2 entries. On the CADR
the entry is five bits, so there are 32 blocks, and the microcode keeps the
last one, 37 octal, as the invalid block: at most 31 regions are mapped at
once (`ADVANCE-SECOND-LEVEL-MAP-REUSE-POINTER` in System 100's
`sys/ucadr/uc-page-fault.lisp`). QUUX's six bits give 64 blocks, 2,048
level-2 entries, and 63 regions.

**The sixth bit travels on the two bits the CADR leaves spare.**

| | CADR | QUUX |
|---|---|---|
| Read back, `MAP(MD)` | entry in `<28:24>`, bit 29 always 0 --- VMEMDR 1A01 drives it from `HI12` through a 74S240 | entry in `<29:24>` |
| Written, a store to `WRITE-MAP` with `VMA<26>` | entry from `VMA<31:27>` (`mit/cadr/ir.bits`) | bits 4:0 from `VMA<31:27>`, bit 5 from `VMA<24>` |
| Level-2 entry chosen | `{entry, VMA<12:8>}`, 1,024 entries | the same, 2,048 entries |

Bits 31 and 30 of `MAP(MD)` are the write and read faults on both, and bit
24 of `VMA` reaches no map write on the CADR. A store that writes both levels
at once addresses level 2 with the level-1 bits zero on both machines
(`Machine::write_map` has why).

`tests/quux.rs` holds the six-bit entry written through `VMA<24>` and read
back in `MAP(MD)<29:24>`, and a translation through a block above 37, on
`micro` and `rtl`; the same store on the CADR keeps five bits and reads bit
29 as 0.

## How software tells the two apart

**QUUX answers who it is in functional source 16, its MACHINE-ID**, one
microinstruction,
no bus cycle:

| Bits | QUUX | CADR |
|---|---|---|
| 31:16 | signature `0x5155` | nothing drives the M bus: all ones |
| 15:4 | hardware revision: 3 --- 1 the six-bit map, 2 the 16K PDL buffer, 3 the multiply and divide | |
| 3:0 | processor type: 4 | |

Source 16 is one MIT left unassigned: the 74S138 on page SOURCE that
decodes it has that output unconnected, and neither microcode 323 nor
microcode 1000 reads it. `IR<30>` is in no source decode, so source 36 is the
same. Source 17 is left open on both machines. A machine is QUUX only if bits
31:16 hold the signature; the revision says which QUUX, each one containing
the last.

`tests/quux.rs` holds the word on both engines and the CADR's all ones;
`the_unassigned_sources_read_all_ones_on_the_board` in `tests/output_bus.rs`
holds the CADR's on the netlist.

**Unverified:** that a real CADR reads all ones there. The M bus has only
tri-state drivers and no pull-ups, so for an unassigned source it floats, and
TTL reading an open input as high is what the netlist model does and what
the parts usually do, not what a datasheet promises. The 16-bit signature is
what makes that safe: a floating bus would pass for QUUX once in 65,536 at
worst. A CADR reading source 16 would settle it.

## The PDL buffer

**QUUX's PDL buffer is 16K words**, its pointer and index 14 bits where the
CADR's are 10 (revision 2). They read back whole in functional sources 2 and
3, whose upper bits read 0 on the CADR. `quux_s_pdl_buffer_is_4k_or_16k` in
`tests/quux.rs` holds a push past word 1777 landing above it and the wrap at
the buffer's own size. It needs QUUX's boot PROM (below): MIT's stops copying
A memory in on the index wrapping at 2000 words. MIT's microcode 323 does not
run on it (`microcode_323_does_not_run_on_quux_revision_2`); microcode for
QUUX has to know the size.

## The feature page

**QUUX lists its sizes in one page of Xbus I/O space**, physical `17377000`
to `17377377` (page 36776), just below the page the display's control
registers and the disk controller share. It is read-only and read like any
device register, through the map:

| Word | QUUX, revision 3 |
|---|---|
| 0 | the MACHINE-ID, as source 16 gives it |
| 1 | level-1 entry: 6 bits |
| 2 | level-2 map: 2,048 entries |
| 3 | PDL buffer: 16,384 words |
| 4 | control store: 16,384 words |
| 5 | A memory: 1,024 words |
| 6 | dispatch memory: 2,048 words |
| 7 | multiply and divide: 3, bit 0 `MUL` and bit 1 `DIV` |
| 10-377 | 0 |

Nothing answers at that page on the CADR --- in muir's model of it the
display answers pages 36000-36177, 36400-36577 and 36777, the disk controller
36777, and nothing else in Xbus I/O space --- so a read there times out and
sets the Xbus NXM bit, as a read of any empty I/O address does. Software
reads source 16 first and the page only on QUUX, and so never waits for the
timeout. `quux_lists_its_sizes_in_its_feature_page` in `tests/quux.rs` holds
the page on QUUX and the timeout on the CADR, on both engines.

## Multiply and divide

**QUUX multiplies in one instruction and divides in one**, ALU functions 42
and 43 (revision 3). The CADR takes a step per bit: `MUS`, `DVS1`, `DVS` and
`DVREM` are ALU functions 40, 51, 41 and 45 (`mit/cadr/ir.bits`, ALU
FUNCTIONS), and microcode 323's `MPY` runs 32 multiply steps, its `DIV` a
first step, 31 steps, a last step and the remainder correction (System 1001's
`sys/ucadr/uc-arith.lisp`). On the CADR, 42 and 43 are no multiply or divide:
the 74S139 at SOURCE 3D04 that makes `-MUL` and `-DIV` from `IR<4:3>` has
outputs 2 and 3 unconnected, so they are the 74S181 functions their bits
select.

| | `MUL`, 42 | `DIV`, 43 |
|---|---|---|
| Is | 32 `MULTIPLY-STEP`s | `DIVIDE-FIRST-STEP`, then 31 `DIVIDE-STEP`s |
| M source | the high word to add into, usually 0 | the high dividend |
| A source | the multiplicand | the divisor |
| `Q` before | the multiplier | the low dividend |
| Output bus | the product's high word | the partial remainder |
| `Q` after | the product's low word | the quotient; `Q<31>` the first step's bit, set on overflow or a zero divisor |
| Time | one ordinary microcycle | held until 330 ns after it entered `IR` |

Each step's M operand is the output bus of the step before, as when the
microcode writes the step's result back to the same M location. Both
instructions decode on `IR<8>` and `IR<4:3>` only, as the '139 does, and
drive the output bus and load `Q` whatever the output selector `IR<13:12>` and
the Q control `IR<1:0>` say. `DIVIDE-LAST-STEP` and `DVREM` stay the CADR's
separate instructions.

**The divider's hold** is a `-WAIT` term of QUUX's own: the divider is busy
while a `DIV` stands in `IR`, not nopped, and 330 ns (`muldiv::DIV_NS`, 32
quotient bits and a load at 10 ns each) have not passed since the clock edge
that loaded `IR`. The master clock runs on, so the bus interface carries on,
and the microcycle starts at the first master clock edge after that: the
fewest whole generator cycles covering 330 ns: two at the boot's 220 ns, three
at the normal 145 and the fast 135. The time does not depend on the operands. A halt during the
hold stops the machine with the `DIV` still in `IR`. The hold does not stop a
single step, as `-WAIT` does not; by then the divider is done.

`tests/muldiv.rs` holds each against the step sequence on the CADR, for many
operands and every output selector and Q control, on `micro` and `rtl`, with
the step sequence itself held to the netlist; the CADR's 42 and 43 to the
netlist; the hold's length on both engines; a halted and single-stepped `DIV`;
and a checkpoint taken during one.

## Its boot PROM

**QUUX boots from its own PROM, version 1000** (`data/quux-promh.mcr`),
MIT's version 9 changed so that a PDL buffer of any width from 1K up boots.
MIT's PROM loads A memory through the PDL buffer and stops copying it out
when the PDL index wraps to 0 (`FILL-A-LOOP` in `mit/sys/ucadr/promh.text`),
which on the CADR's 10-bit index is after 2000 words; on a wider index the
copy runs on and overwrites A memory with what lies above. Version 1000 stops
after 2000 words by count. The same PROM boots the CADR, whose index never
passes 1777. `--machine quux` loads it; the CADR keeps MIT's.

## Its microcode

**Microcode 1000 runs on both machines**, muir-sys's first change to MIT's
323, made from System 1001's sources. At boot it reads functional source 16.
Without the signature it is on a CADR: processor type 1, five-bit level-1
entries, invalid block 37. With it, the type is the word's bits 3:0, 4, and
from revision 1 on it reads the six-bit entry at `MAP(MD)<29:24>`, writes it
in two deposits, `VMA<31:27>` and `VMA<24>`, and keeps block 77 as the
invalid one. On both it keeps the reverse first-level map in system
communication area words 640 to 737 and the swap-out CCWs at 440 to 457. It
checks at boot that block 0's level-1 entry reads back as the invalid entry
the MACHINE-ID promised, and stops at `MAP-WIDTH-MISMATCH` if it does not.

`tests/system_1001.rs` holds it, with the microcode's files in the gitignored
`ref/ucode-1000`: System 1001, the band as released, reaches its listener on
QUUX on both engines with version 1000 and type 4, and on the CADR with
version 1000 and type 1 and no level-1 entry above block 37. The band reads
the error table for the running version at boot, `SYS: UBIN; UCADR TBL
1000`, so the served `sys/ubin/ucadr.tbl` must be microcode 1000's.

## What the microcode had to do differently

Microcode 323 knows the CADR's map, and runs on QUUX as on a CADR: System
1001 on it reaches its listener on both engines with no level-1 entry naming
a block above 37 (`system_1001_runs_on_quux_as_on_the_cadr` in
`tests/system_1001.rs`), so it uses 31 regions. Using the other 32 takes
microcode written for QUUX. From its sources (System 1001's
`sys/ucadr/`):

- `MAP-FIRST-LEVEL-MAP` and `MAP-WRITE-FIRST-LEVEL-MAP` are five-bit fields
  (`uc-page-fault.lisp`), and the write field cannot simply widen, `VMA<32>`
  not existing: the sixth bit is a second deposit, at `VMA<24>`.
- 37 octal is "no block" in three comparisons (`uc-page-fault.lisp`) and
  block 37 the invalid block, zeroed at boot (`uc-cold-disk.lisp`); on QUUX
  both are 77.
- The reverse first-level map has one word per block in the system
  communication area, words 440 to 477, and the keyboard buffer's header
  follows at 500: 64 blocks' worth does not fit there and has to move.

**Unverified:** that nothing else in the band assumes 32 blocks. What is
known is by reading the sources, and a band run on QUUX's own microcode would
settle it.

## Not modeled

`chip` is the CADR's boards, netlist for netlist, and QUUX has none: a run
that asks for both is refused.
