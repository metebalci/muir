//! The boot PROM, and the shape it is burned in.
//!
//! The engines boot MIT's own microcode file, `mit/sys/ubin/promh.mcr`,
//! out of `SYS: UBIN;` --- System 100's own `sys/ubin/promh.mcr`, taken
//! from the release unchanged, as `mit/README.md` records.  [`boot_prom`]
//! is that file's words in the 1K the board decodes as PROM
//! ([`PROM_WORDS`]).  [`parse_mcr`] reads a PROM of one's own out of the
//! same kind of file, which is what `muir --prom` hands it.
//!
//! What the PROM *chips* hold is not a control store word.  A bank of six
//! 74S472s, 512 by 8 each, holds 48 bits a word and the microinstruction is
//! 48 bits, but they are not the same 48.  Page PROM0 of `data/CADR.netlist`
//! shows it on the top chip of the bank, 1B19, whose eight data pins carry
//! `I40` to `I45`, `I47` and `I48` --- `I46` is on no chip:
//!
//! | bit | holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | 47 | odd parity over bits 46:0 |
//! | 46 | the microinstruction's `IR<47>` |
//! | 45:0 | the microinstruction's `IR<45:0>` |
//!
//! `IR<46>`, the statistics bit, is not stored at all --- and no word of the
//! boot PROM sets it, so nothing is lost.  [`boot_prom_image`] does that
//! conversion, and it is what `Chip::load_prom` takes, because the chips hold
//! what was burned.
//!
//! Not every recovered copy of "version 9" is the same program, so which
//! copy is loaded matters: the engines run System 100's own, and
//! `tests/prom.rs` holds `mit/sys/ubin/promh.mcr` to the release's file byte
//! for byte.
