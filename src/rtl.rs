//! The `rtl` engine: the CADR datapath, on the machine's own clock.
//!
//! A microcycle is two phases, not six states. `-CLK0` is `-TPCLK AND
//! MACHRUN` at CLOCK2 1D10 and `CLK1..CLK5` are `NOT(-CLK0)` through the 7428
//! buffers at 1D05, 1C01 and 1C11, so every edge-triggered register on the
//! board takes **one edge per microcycle**, at the cycle boundary.
//! `tests/rtl.rs` measures that on the running board rather than assuming it.
//!
//! Between edges the clock is a level, and the board reads it as one:
//!
//! - **read phase**, `CLK` high. The scratchpad address multiplexers at ACTL
//!   3A16, MCTL 4B19 and PDLCTL 4C22 select the instruction's own source
//!   fields, the 74S373s at ALATCH, MLATCH, PLATCH and SPCLCH follow the
//!   memories, `-TSE1..4` let the sources drive, and the ALU settles.
//! - **write phase**, `CLK` low. The multiplexers select `WADR`, the latches
//!   hold what they caught, and `-WP1..4` write.
//!
//! So one microcycle is `Rtl::read_phase`, which evaluates the whole
//! combinational network once, then `Rtl::write_phase`, then
//! `Rtl::clock_edge`, where every register takes what the read phase held.
//!
//! Three things about the board are easy to model one step out of place, and
//! all three are read off `data/CADR.netlist` here.
//!
//! **The scratchpads are asynchronous and the latches are the state.** They
//! are 93425As with no clock pin, so what holds a word between phases is the
//! 74S373 at ALATCH, MLATCH, PLATCH or SPCLCH and not the memory. Modelling
//! the memory as a register loaded early is the 74S373 drawn one state too
//! soon.
//!
//! **A scratchpad write is one microcycle behind the instruction that
//! computed it.** `WADR`, `DESTD`, `DESTMD`, `PDLWRITED` and `WMAPD` are all
//! registered on the clock edge, so the pulse that stores a word belongs to
//! the cycle after the one that produced it. What hides that from the
//! microcode is the pass-around: the comparators at ACTL 3B21/3B27 and MCTL
//! 4B18 match the instruction's source address against the pending `WADR`
//! and put `L` on the bus instead of the memory's output. Writing
//! immediately with no pass-around gives the same answer to every program,
//! so nothing the microcode can do tells the two apart --- only the
//! diagnostic interface, reading a scratchpad between the two cycles.
//!
//! **There is no MMU state.** Both map levels are asynchronous and chained
//! combinationally: VMEM0 1C14 is addressed by `MAPI13..23` and drives
//! `-VMAP4..0`, which are VMEM1 1E04's address along with `-MAPI8A..12A`. A
//! lookup is a ripple through two rams inside one cycle. `MAPI` itself is
//! `VMA` while `MEMSTART` is up and `MD` otherwise, off the 74S258s at VMAS
//! 1C20 and its fellows.
//!
//! **The memory cycle is the board's too**, from MIT's own specification of
//! it: `MEMPREPARE` to `MEMSTART` to `-MEMRQ`, `MBUSY` waiting on `-MEMACK`
//! from the bus interface in `src/busint.rs`, `-LOADMD` strobing `MD` when
//! the interface says and `READ IN PROGRESS` falling 140 ns after it,
//! with `WAIT` and `HANG` holding the clock generator off meanwhile. A stall
//! costs time and not a microcycle. `Rtl::stall` has the two gates and
//! `Rtl::after_memack` the two delays.
