//! QUUX's one-instruction multiply and divide: ALU functions 42 and 43.
//!
//! The CADR multiplies and divides a bit a microinstruction. `ir.bits`' ALU
//! FUNCTIONS table has `MUS` at 40, `DVS` at 41, `DVS1` at 51 and `DVREM` at
//! 45, and `uc-arith.lisp`'s `MPY` runs 32 multiply steps and its `DIV` a
//! first step and 32 more. On page SOURCE the 74S139 at 3D04 decodes
//! `IR<4:3>` under `-SPECALU` into `-MUL` and `-DIV` and leaves its outputs
//! 2 and 3 unconnected, so on the CADR functions 42 and 43 are the ordinary
//! 74S181 functions their bits select ([`crate::ttl::alu_control`]).
//!
//! QUUX gives those two codes a unit of their own:
//!
//! - **`MUL`, 42**: what 32 multiply steps leave, each step's M operand the
//!   output bus of the step before and the first the instruction's M
//!   source, the A source the multiplicand throughout, `Q` the multiplier.
//!   The output bus carries the high word and `Q` is loaded with the low.
//!   Done in the microcycle, like any ALU function.
//! - **`DIV`, 43**: what a first divide step and 31 divide steps leave, each
//!   shifting the output bus and `Q` left as `DIVIDE-STEP` does, the M
//!   source the high dividend and the partial remainder, `Q` the low
//!   dividend and the quotient, the A source the divisor. `DIVIDE-LAST-STEP`
//!   and `DVREM` stay separate instructions. The first step's quotient bit,
//!   which `DIV` tests for overflow straight after `DVS1`, ends in `Q<31>`.
//!
//! Both decode on `IR<8>` and `IR<4:3>` as the '139 does, `IR<7:5>` not
//! looked at; both drive the output bus and load `Q` whatever the output
//! selector `IR<13:12>` and the Q control `IR<1:0>` say.
//!
//! Each is defined as the steps, and computed by running them: the step here
//! is [`crate::ttl::alu_control`] and [`crate::ttl::alu`], the model both
//! engines run a CADR step on and that `tests/muldiv.rs` holds to the
//! netlist, and the shifts are the output bus's and `Q`'s. So one
//! instruction is bit for bit the sequence it replaces, for any operands.
