//! The Xbus and the Unibus, answered by [`Machine`]: the far end of the bus
//! interface board, which with the board and the cables is
//! [`crate::cable::FarEnd`], the far end of the processor board.
//!
//! The bus interface is the master of both buses here, and what it does on
//! them is MIT's: "You treat XBUSRQ as MSYN and XBUSACK as SSYN, Unibus-style
//! and completely asynchronous" (`busint.erface`), so both sides are the same
//! handshake. A request comes with the address and, for a write, the data;
//! this puts the data on the bus for a read, acknowledges, and holds both
//! until the request drops. "On a read, the leading edge of XBUSACK is what
//! clocks in the data", so the data goes on before the acknowledge. A device
//! that is not there does not answer, and the board's own timeout ends the
//! cycle.
//!
//! Every bus line is active low and open collector, pulled up by
//! [`crate::cable::busint_board`]; a one is put on a line by pulling it low,
//! a zero by letting go, which leaves the terminator's pull-up in place.
//! On the Unibus this drives the interface's nets. On the Xbus it asserts
//! onto [`crate::xbus::Xbus`], which is what carries the wires between the
//! interface and the memory boards, and main memory is theirs: this
//! answers the disk controller and the display and keeps its copy of
//! `main` current for the disk's DMA. With no boards on the backplane it
//! answers memory too, as it did before there were any. The board's own
//! Unibus block --- `766000` to `766176`, the diagnostic registers, the
//! interrupt and error status and the Unibus map,
//! [`crate::busint::register`] --- is answered on the board and not here.
