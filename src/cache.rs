//! QUUX's memory cache, H2: a unified, write-through cache of main memory
//! in front of the bus, as `rtl` times it.
//!
//! It holds tags and nothing else. `rtl` takes a read's word from main
//! memory when the cycle ends, and a write-through cache never holds a word
//! main memory does not, so what the machine reads is right by
//! construction; the cache decides only how soon a read is acknowledged.
//! The fabric's cache holds the data too, and its contract is this one's
//! timing plus that coherence.
//!
//! - **Physical addresses**, after the map, and **main memory only**: Xbus
//!   I/O space and the Unibus are not cached, their reads having side
//!   effects or being a device's.
//! - **Reads**: a hit is acknowledged [`CacheConfig::hit_ns`] after the
//!   request, with no bus cycle; a miss is the memory board's cycle, and
//!   fills the line the word is in.
//! - **Writes** go through to the board and allocate nothing; a line that
//!   holds the word keeps it. With the write buffer, a write is
//!   acknowledged after the hit time and the board runs it behind the
//!   processor; a write finding the buffer still full waits for the board
//!   to empty it. The word is main memory's from the acknowledgement, as a
//!   read of it after, hit or miss, would find it through the buffer.
//! - **Coherence**: anything else that writes main memory --- the disk's
//!   transfers --- invalidates the cache, all of it ([`Cache::invalidate`]).
//!
//! Replacement is least recently used within a set.
