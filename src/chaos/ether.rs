//! The ether: the cable as a medium, and the nodes on its model side.
//!
//! AIM-628 §2.3: the transceiver "impresses [the interface's signal] onto
//! the cable as a level of about 8 volts for a 1, or 0 volts (open
//! circuit) for a 0 ... When the cable is idle it is held at 0 volts by
//! the terminations." So the cable's level is the OR of everything
//! driving it, every transceiver hears the whole cable including its own
//! transmission, and one "detects interference (another transceiver
//! transmitting at the same time as this one) and informs the
//! interface."
//!
//! One side of this ether is the netlist board, through
//! [`super::cable::OnCable`]; the other is any number of [`Node`]s ---
//! the CHUDP link that carries the hosts off this machine, and whatever a
//! caller in this process puts there ---
//! which see every packet and offer packets to send. The ether frames,
//! codes and decodes, and keeps the etiquette of §2.6: a node takes its
//! turn after a packet, and goes if the cable is idle then. A transmitter
//! that has committed --- the board at its turn timer's instant, a
//! transmitter that has not heard the cable --- goes whether or not the
//! cable is busy, and two driving high at once is §2.3's interference: a
//! transmitter whose clock edge finds it aborts and holds the cable high
//! for [`ABORT_HOLD_NS`], the abort signal, and what was left on the
//! cable reaches every receiver as wreckage, failing its check.
//!
//! Two things the stations on this side of the cable do because the
//! hardware does them, and both are timed here rather than in the nodes:
//!
//! - **The behavioral board's busy receiver aborts**, AIM-628 §2.5: a
//!   frame addressed to it while its buffer is full is counted and the
//!   sender stopped, [`BUSY_ABORT_NS`] into the frame. The netlist board
//!   drives its own cable and does this in its gates; a behavioral board
//!   has the ether do it for it, from the receiver's state it is given
//!   through [`Ether::board_receiver`].
//! - **A station cannot offer its next frame at once.** Its host refills
//!   the outgoing buffer a word at a time and reads `START`, which is
//!   [`refill`], and its turn then comes on the turn timer's round,
//!   [`ROUND_NS`]. [`Node::station`] says which nodes stand for
//!   stations; [`Capture`] is an instrument and does not.
