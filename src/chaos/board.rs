//! The Chaosnet interface as a behaviour, for the engines whose I/O board
//! is `rtl`'s model: the registers of [`super::interface`] over an
//! [`Ether`], so that the stations on the cable answer `rtl` as they
//! answer the netlist board.  The netlist board is the authority:
//! `tests/chaos_rtl.rs` runs the same register sequences on both, and
//! holds the instants.
//!
//! What the software does with it is microcode 323's `uc-chaos.lisp`, the
//! Unibus interrupt at vector 270: with Receive Done up it reads the bit
//! count, the packet's words out of the read buffer, the CSR again, and
//! writes the CSR with Clear Receiver; to transmit it writes the words and
//! reads 764152; it dismisses by writing the two interrupt enables.
//!
//! When a frame goes out is the **turn timer's**, page LMTURN of the I/O
//! board: a twelve-bit counter of 74LS193s counting down on a microsecond
//! clock that runs only while the cable is idle, loaded with the address
//! difference of every packet heard ([`turn_byte`]), and the transmitter
//! starting on the rising edge of its bit 7 --- `Turn`, with every
//! interval measured on the netlist board.
