/// takes **`RACT` on pin 3**, with `CWE` (pin 10) tied to `HI1` so it
/// divides whenever it is clocked, and `ER` (pin 13) on `CRCERR`, which
/// is the CSR's CRC Error bit through the 74LS244 at LMDATP `0D17`. So
/// the pin in dispute is the one pin of the three carrying a signal.
///
/// `mit/cadrio/iob.wlr` names those pins the other way round from
/// `src/part.rs`: it has pin 3 `S2`, pin 5 `S1` and pin 8 `S0`, on both
/// parts. **The wiring is not in dispute** --- the wire list and the

/// names pin 11 `D` on both, which is what settles pin 11 --- only the
/// three select names, which the data sheet's own connection diagram and
/// logic symbol disagree about as well.
///
/// What is measured here is the board deciding it, on a frame it
/// transmitted itself. `RACT` is up for every one of the clock edges
/// that enter the frame and none fall outside it, so the code is not 0
/// during the division under either naming; and the register reaches all
/// zero on the last of those edges, `CRCERR` falling with it. That only
/// happens with pin 3 as the **low** bit of the code: `RACT` up is then
/// code 1, the sheet's "CRC-16 reverse", which is the reciprocal of the
/// transmitter's CRC-16 --- and the reciprocal is what this stream needs,
/// because AIM-628 §2.5 puts a frame on the cable in reverse bit order
/// (`chaos::packet::frame` reverses the bits, and a reversed message is
/// divisible by the reciprocal of the polynomial that divides the
/// original). Under the wire list's names the code would be 4, a degree-8
/// polynomial unrelated to CRC-16: with the model's mapping flipped to
/// `(pin 3 << 2) | (pin 5 << 1) | pin 8` this test fails at `CRCERR`, and
/// `a_packet_loops_back_through_the_board` reports CRC Error on a frame
/// the board had just sent.
///
/// **Unverified: that a real 9401 carries the pin names `src/part.rs`
/// gives it.** What is held here is narrower and does not need them --- a
/// board that cannot check its own frame is not the board MIT ran, so the
/// wire list's select names and this board's behavior cannot both be
/// right. What would settle the names: a Fairchild 9401 sheet whose
/// connection diagram and logic symbol agree, or the part in hand.

/// started the second frame has gone by, and `MY.TURN^`, bit 7 of the
