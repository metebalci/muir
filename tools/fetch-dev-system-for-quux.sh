# Fetch QUUX's system in development, muir-sys's rolling release.
#
# `dev-system-for-quux` is a prerelease of https://github.com/metebalci/muir-sys
# whose files are replaced with each new build of muir-sys's `main`; its tag
# never moves, and its README names the build. It is for trying the newest
# system, never for tests or CI, whose bytes must not move:
# `fetch-system-for-quux.sh` fetches the pinned release for those.
#
# The release's files, and where this puts them:
#
#   SHA256SUMS                          every file below, the README
#                                       included, and the disk uncompressed
#   README                              the build: commit, date, sums
#   dev-system-for-quux-sys.tar.gz      the sources, unpacked to
#                                       vendor/dev-system-for-quux/
#   dev-system-for-quux-disk.vhd.gz     QUUX's disk, decompressed to
#                                       vendor/run/dev-system-for-quux-disk.vhd
#   dev-system-for-quux-promh.mcr       the boot PROM (`quux --prom`)
#
# and it keeps the machine's host folder, its file root,
# vendor/run/dev-system-for-quux-root/: copies of the sources' `sys/` and
# `site/`, replaced with each new build, and `home/lispm/`, the login's
# home, made empty once and kept.
#
# Nothing is pinned here, so the files are checked against each other: the
# release's SHA256SUMS is downloaded first, then every file into a staging
# directory, then SHA256SUMS again. The two must be equal and every file
# must match its line, so the disk, the sources, the PROM and the README
# all come from one build; a replacement under way shows as a mismatch. On
# a failure this waits 60 seconds and tries once more. The number and the
# format are checked as in `fetch-system-for-quux.sh`: the sources must
# unpack to `dev-system-for-quux/`, and the disk must be a dynamic VHD
# holding a GPT. Only then is the old build replaced, by renaming the
# staging directory into place, and the old disk is removed before that and
# the new one moved in last, so a run cut short leaves no disk from one
# build beside sources from another.
#
# The disk is checked as it is decompressed and not afterwards: a machine
# writes to the disk it runs on. So when the release's SHA256SUMS is the one
# kept from the last run and the disk is in place, nothing is replaced, and
# the machine keeps its disk. DEV_SYSTEM_FOR_QUUX_BASE names another place
# to download from.
#
# usage: tools/fetch-dev-system-for-quux.sh
# then:  quux --prom vendor/dev-system-for-quux/dev-system-for-quux-promh.mcr \
#             --disk-pack vendor/run/dev-system-for-quux-disk.vhd \
#             --file-root vendor/run/dev-system-for-quux-root
